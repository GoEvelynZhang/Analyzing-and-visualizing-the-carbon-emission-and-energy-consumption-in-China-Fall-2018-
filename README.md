# Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission in China 
Abstract:

  Concerned about the rising threat from climate change, this project looks into the data regarding energy consumption and carbon emission in China, the biggest carbon emitter in the world. According to the analysis, China is already making great effort in cutting its carbon emission but is still faced with huge challenge. The analysis reveals two underlying issues requiring enormous attention - the regional differences of development in China, as well as its problematic energy structure. Only by tackling the two key issues, can China realize the goal of low-carbon development. On the other hand, the two issues also embody huge economic and environmental potential, which offers China a great opportunity.
