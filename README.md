# Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission in China 
### refer to the pdf for the compete report with graphs
Abstract:

  Concerned about the rising threat from climate change, this project looks into the data regarding energy consumption and carbon emission in China, the biggest carbon emitter in the world. According to the analysis, China is already making great effort in cutting its carbon emission but is still faced with huge challenge. The analysis reveals two underlying issues requiring enormous attention - the regional differences of development in China, as well as its problematic energy structure. Only by tackling the two key issues, can China realize the goal of low-carbon development. On the other hand, the two issues also embody huge economic and environmental potential, which offers China a great opportunity.
  
 This project is generally divided into two parts. In part one, it focuses on the time-series analysis of the carbon emission and energy consumption between 1995 and 2015, focusing both on the national and provincial level. It would include statistics such as the carbon emission per capita, carbon emission per GDP, raw energy to clean energy consumption ratio, etc. In part two, it focuses on finding the contributors of carbon emission using provincial-level data, and it includes the population, the GDP growth rate, the trade activity, the location, the industry composition, and energy compositions as regressors.
